// We use mutex because we want to avoid data races when the writer is accessed from multiple processes and we still need interior mutability
// We spinlocks/spin mutexes rather than regular ones because we don't have the concept of threads and blocking (and other OS abstractions)
// Weâ€™re passing the port address 0x3F8, which is the standard port number for the first serial interface.
