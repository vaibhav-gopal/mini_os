// A vga text buffer is a special area in memory (0xb8000) that displays its contents on the screen
// 25 lines with 80 character cells each --> each character cell has an ASCII character + foreground and background colors + blink
// Each character cell in the vga buffer is represented by 2 bytes:
// Bits 0-7 = ASCII character
// Bits 8-11 = Foreground Color w/ Bit 4 = bright modifier
// Bits 12-15 = Background Color w/ Bit 5 = blink modifier

// As to how we are able to access I/O only by accessing memory is b/c of "memory mapped I/O"

// Use spinning mutexes (spinlocks) rather than regular mutexes which require blocking support and threads (which we don't have)
// now why do we need "safe interior mutability" if our kernal won't even have the concept of threads in the first place!!!???
// Answer --> From the perspective of the compiler an interrupt handler is a thread. The interrupt handler could run in the middle of a write operation,
//   thus seeing a partial write, a write that never actually happened in the program you wrote (for example because the compiler stored a temporary value there
//   to save stack space and would write the correct value at a later time) or any other bad thing. Because interrupt handlers are implemented in this kernel,
//   we have data races. Also data races are not the only issue. It is for example not acceptable to have two mutable references to the same static mut, just like any other data.
//   static mut however makes it quite easy to cause two mutable references to it at the same time.
